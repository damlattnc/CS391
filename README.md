# Tabletop Character Manager  

In this project we made a website that allows the user to manage their characters in tabletop games like Dungeons & Dragons. 
## Login Page
The user will be able to access the system once they log into the system if they have already created an account. If not, they can simply create a new account by clicking on "Sign Up" and filling necessary fields.
## Characters Page
After logging in, the user can see an array of the created characters and a "+" button on the left bar to add another character. On the right side of the screen, the user will see the character sheet of their chosen character where they will be free to change any data as they see fit. Also on the left bar, the user can either log out or choose to roll a die. 
## Dice Roll Page
If the user chooses to roll a die, a new page will show up on the right to ask how many faces the die should have and after writing it and pressing the roll button the website will generate a random number.
### For more information on usage cases please refer to the document down below.
## Project Members and Their Responsibilities
Although we cooperated on all parts of code (we wrote our code while sharing our screens), each member spent majority of their time on the following tasks:
### Alanur Bilgili: Javascript functions and data storage
### Damla Tütüncü: Javascript functions on the character page and the login page
### Murat Can Altun: Documentation and design, HTML and CSS code
## Libraries Used
We used JQuery to allow the user to upload images and to sign up.
## Instructions
You can start by the LoginScreen.html page and follow the explanations made in the beginning of this document to test our project.
