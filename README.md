# Tabletop Character Manager  

In this project we made a website that allows the user to manage their characters in tabletop games like Dungeons & Dragons. 
## Login Page
The user will be able to access the system once they log into the system if they have already created an account. If not, they can simply create a new account by clicking on "Register" and filling necessary fields.
## Characters Page
After logging in, the user can add a portrait of their character, but this portrait will not be stored. On the right side of the screen, the user will see the character sheet of their chosen character where they will be free to change any data as they see fit. Also on the left bar, the user can either log out or choose to roll a die. After pressing the "Append" button, all the data will be given to the user via a txt file.
## Dice Roll Page
If the user chooses to roll a die, a new page will show up on the right to ask how many faces the die should have and after writing it and pressing the roll button the website will generate a random number.
### For more information on usage cases please refer to the document down below.
